    <h3>An experience on Luni.app</h3>

      <p class="prompt1">
        <span
          >What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
          the experience?</span

        <!-- I wanted to be able to clearly distinguish the question from the 
         answer in my pargraphs, however I wanted this to remain inline and avoid
          using headings. I could not figure out how to best do this and 
          experimented with line spacing and colour changing, before eventually 
          finding the <br> element. I like -->
        The first thing I noticed were all the different floating sections, and
        immediatly began hovering my mouse over each, admiring all the
        animations that occured when I hovered.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt2">
        <span
          >Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.</span
        ><br />
        <br />
        Luni numerous small actions you could make on the website. Most of these
        actions were due to some of the 3d items allowing you to click on them,
        and they would each have unique animations. The objects and actions I
        found included; Turning on and off tablets, kicking a soccer and
        basketball, flipping an egg and hitting a punching bag. By moving my
        mouse I was also able to slightly change the perspective I was viewing
        the 3d objects, and a double swipe allowed me to shift to a new 3d
        environment.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt3">
        <span>
          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        I spent most of my time scrolling through the environments and looking
        at all the different 3d objects found in them. When I found out some
        allowed you to click on them, I then aimed to find all the interactive
        items, as I enjoyed watching the respective animatons.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt4">
        <span
          >What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        My most common action was the swipe that allowed me to siwtch the 3d
        scene I was looking at. I used this a lot as there were multiple scenes
        to get through, but because I would go back and forth between to compare
        animations. I enjoyed swiping as it was a satisfying transition, which
        also contributed to me doing it so much.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt5">
        <span
          >What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />It seems to me like the primary goal is leading the viewers eye
        through the digital environments, so that they are motivated to explore
        all the infomation on the website. Another primary goals seems to be
        showcasing some of the talent and expertise of the company, particulary
        their 3d modelling work.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt6">
        <span
          >How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
          goal?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />It is clear they want to grab viewers attention and keep them
        exploring through the seemingly 'decorative' interactive features. These
        include animations such as the basketball being hit, which are really
        only to promote user engagement with the website, and therefore keeping
        them hooked and motivated to keep exploring the website
      </p>
      <p class="prompt7">
        <span
          >What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        I get the impression the website should be explored, as there multiple
        3d environments with many different elements. So I believe the
        experience should be interacted with for at least a couple of minutes
        whilst you move through the scenes.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt8">
        <span
          >How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        It communicates this through the interactive elements. They act as
        little bonus features to be discovered, prompting viewers to stay
        exploring the website.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt9">
        <span
          >What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        The website mainly references 3d modeling. Multiple detailed objects are
        present and combined to make immersive environments, and the company is
        clearly showing off their 3d modelling skills.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt10">
        <span
          >What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        I believe it means that the environemts should be given attention and
        explored, as they clearly want to be seen by the company. They are not
        just decorative and warrant paying attention to the skills required to
        construct them.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt11">
        <span
          >What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        The references communicate that I should feel entertained and interested
        in the 3d modeling. It is there to showcase the expertise of the
        company, and so I should let myself enjoy what they are freely sharing.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt12">
        <span
          >What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part frustrating?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        Mainly due to having so many complex 3d models and animations, the
        website doesn't run too smoothly, even on a Macbook, and this does take
        a lot away from the environments.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt13">
        <span
          >What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        I love the way the interactions are animated; they are not entirely
        realistic but no cartoonish. They are 'oddly satisfying' and I'm sure
        this was a goal of the company.
