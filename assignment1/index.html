        <!-- I wanted to be able to clearly distinguish the question from the 
         answer in my pargraphs, however I wanted this to remain inline and avoid
          using headings. I could not figure out how to best do this and 
          experimented with line spacing and colour changing, before eventually 
          finding the <br> element. I like -->
        The first thing I noticed were all the different floating sections, and
        immediatly began hovering my mouse over each, admiring all the
        animations that occured when I hovered.

        <br />
        Luni numerous small actions you could make on the website. Most of these
        actions were due to some of the 3d items allowing you to click on them,
        and they would each have unique animations. The objects and actions I
        found included; Turning on and off tablets, kicking a soccer and
        basketball, flipping an egg and hitting a punching bag. By moving my
        mouse I was also able to slightly change the perspective I was viewing
        the 3d objects, and a double swipe allowed me to shift to a new 3d
        environment.

      <p class="prompt3">
        <span>
          What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        I spent most of my time scrolling through the environments and looking
        at all the different 3d objects found in them. When I found out some
        allowed you to click on them, I then aimed to find all the interactive
        items, as I enjoyed watching the respective animatons.
      </p>
      <p class="prompt4">
        <span
          >What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?</span
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        My most common action was the swipe that allowed me to siwtch the 3d
        scene I was looking at. I used this a lot as there were multiple scenes
        to get through, but because I would go back and forth between to compare
        animations. I enjoyed swiping as it was a satisfying transition, which
        also contributed to me doing it so much.
